    "text": "Well, I created this site at the beginning of the last year. Since then, I’ve been mostly concerned with adjusting minor details, such as setting up my research page. As a result, I have not paid enough attention to my Blog section… until now! Bluntly speaking, my main reason for finally getting my hands dirty with it is because of my resolutions for this year. Honestly, I probably would not do it otherwise.\nEven though I have pretty difficult resolutions for this year, such as dramatically reducing the amount of Coca-Cola I drink daily, I still have others which are way more realistic. One of them is making at least one DataViz per month this year, so why not make the best of it and get started with my Blog?\n\n\nIf this is the first time you hear about me, I think some introduction is in order. Well, I do not have much to say, but I’m a Brazilian Political Scientist who holds an MSc degree (in pol sci) from the University of Brasília. As for my hobbies, I would list mainly watching sports, especially football and tennis, and watching something on TV. For whatever reason, maybe because I was part of the Observatório do Congresso, an extension activity of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Brasília, I’ve developed a deep interest in Data Visualisation, which could be roughly translated to ‘yeah, I think it would be cool to make some pretty graphs’.\nOver the years, my interest in DataViz has led me to get better and better with R, albeit with the caveat that we never actually stop learning and that there’s so much I still do not know. In my opinion, the most amusing aspect of this process is how much I’ve learnt from the community itself. This site, for example, is a direct consequence of mixing lessons from Andrew Heiss, Bea Milz, and Albert Rapp. Even if I have never exchanged a single word with them, they have helped me tremendously in a variety of ways.\nThe same rings true when it comes to DataViz! Actually, most of what I know comes from accompanying the beautiful graphs made for Tidy Tuesday, a project in which the community makes a graphical representation of something based on a public dataset for each week. Even if it is impossible to namely cite all those from whom I’ve learnt something, I’d like to compliment especially Moriah Taylor’s work. Once again, she probably doesn’t even know who I am. Even still, 85% of everything I know about DataViz comes from her.\nMy only problem with TidyTuesday is that I’d rather dedicate my time to something I really love, namely politics, sports, or some random nerdy stuff. For this reason, I have my own Series. Its aim is to make me learn something new in the realm of data visualisation while I use a dataset on something related to Political Science. Sometimes, I also make visualisations about sports or some geek stuff. However, I reserve those for my social media, as I do not think someone interested in my work would search for those things on my site. In any case, for this series, I usually proceed as follows: I see a visualisation I like (most of the time from someone participating in TidyTuesday), and I try to replicate it with minor modifications to my liking. Now that I’m done talking, let’s get to today’s graph.\n\n\n\nRecently, I’ve been reading about coalition agreements. If you live in any Western European country, it’s pretty likely, as we’ll see below, that you know what I’m talking about. To those who don’t know what they are, they are basically public documents onto which governing parties put down the policies that they wish to implement/pursue while they are in office. If you want to get to know more about them, I strongly suggest you read Eichorst (2014), Moury (2011), Moury (2013), and Timmermans (2006). As this literature suggests, coalition agreements do matter for what happens in the period of coalition governance. To exemplify this, Bergman et al. (2024) find that coalition agreements are tied to heightened policy-making productivity.\nIn any case, the central point to me is that not all democracies have coalition governments with the habit of disclosing written coalition agreements. To the best of my knowledge, there are only a few instances of written coalition agreements in presidential democracies, for example. Thus, my aim with the below graphical representation from a PolSci perspective is to see to what extent coalition governments put down the terms of the multiparty deal in Western Europe. I also bear in mind that, while there are several beautiful visualisations about research topics within PolSci, such as Andrew Heiss’ graphs on NGOs and Ruben Mathisen’s graphs on inequality, there are very few exemplars of graphs related to coalition politics in social media.\nWith an eye on DataViz, I want to use the colour background that Ruben Mathisen uses in his graphs. Moreover, as I’ve seen that Outfit is the most used font by Georgios Karamanis in his submissions to TidyTuesday in the last two years, I wanted to give it a try. Given how consistently he’s been using it, it’s pretty likely that the font is pleasing to the eye.\nSo, here we go:\n\n\n\nCoalition Agreements in Western Europe\n\n\nAs it seems, written coalition agreements are common instruments for coalition governments in the region. Putting France aside, all other Western European countries witness the writing of multiparty agreements on at least a 4:1 ratio. However, these numbers are a bit misleading, as we should have to consider the number of coalition governments per country as well. To illustrate this, let’s consider the percentage for the UK. Despite boasting a percentage of 100%, the number of coalition governments there equals to one (Cameron I). Hence, it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the UK is very familiar with coalition agreements since they have not even had enough multiparty governments in the first place.\nEither way, for present purposes, I’m pretty pleased with what we’ve got. The background of the plot is pretty, the font fits well, and we’ve got a plot about coalition governments in hands. All in all, a good start to my journey of making at least one graph a month this year.\nSee you next month!\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#before you proceed, you should download the data from:

    "text": "If this is the first time you hear about me, I think some introduction is in order. Well, I do not have much to say, but I’m a Brazilian Political Scientist who holds an MSc degree (in pol sci) from the University of Brasília. As for my hobbies, I would list mainly watching sports, especially football and tennis, and watching something on TV. For whatever reason, maybe because I was part of the Observatório do Congresso, an extension activity of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Brasília, I’ve developed a deep interest in Data Visualisation, which could be roughly translated to ‘yeah, I think it would be cool to make some pretty graphs’.\nOver the years, my interest in DataViz has led me to get better and better with R, albeit with the caveat that we never actually stop learning and that there’s so much I still do not know. In my opinion, the most amusing aspect of this process is how much I’ve learnt from the community itself. This site, for example, is a direct consequence of mixing lessons from Andrew Heiss, Bea Milz, and Albert Rapp. Even if I have never exchanged a single word with them, they have helped me tremendously in a variety of ways.\nThe same rings true when it comes to DataViz! Actually, most of what I know comes from accompanying the beautiful graphs made for Tidy Tuesday, a project in which the community makes a graphical representation of something based on a public dataset for each week. Even if it is impossible to namely cite all those from whom I’ve learnt something, I’d like to compliment especially Moriah Taylor’s work. Once again, she probably doesn’t even know who I am. Even still, 85% of everything I know about DataViz comes from her.\nMy only problem with TidyTuesday is that I’d rather dedicate my time to something I really love, namely politics, sports, or some random nerdy stuff. For this reason, I have my own Series. Its aim is to make me learn something new in the realm of data visualisation while I use a dataset on something related to Political Science. Sometimes, I also make visualisations about sports or some geek stuff. However, I reserve those for my social media, as I do not think someone interested in my work would search for those things on my site. In any case, for this series, I usually proceed as follows: I see a visualisation I like (most of the time from someone participating in TidyTuesday), and I try to replicate it with minor modifications to my liking. Now that I’m done talking, let’s get to today’s graph."

    "text": "Recently, I’ve been reading about coalition agreements. If you live in any Western European country, it’s pretty likely, as we’ll see below, that you know what I’m talking about. To those who don’t know what they are, they are basically public documents onto which governing parties put down the policies that they wish to implement/pursue while they are in office. If you want to get to know more about them, I strongly suggest you read Eichorst (2014), Moury (2011), Moury (2013), and Timmermans (2006). As this literature suggests, coalition agreements do matter for what happens in the period of coalition governance. For example, Bergman et al. (2024) find that coalition agreements are tied to heightened policy-making productivity.\nIn any case, the central point to me is that not all democracies have coalition governments with the habit of disclosing written coalition agreements. To the best of my knowledge, there are only a few instances of written coalition agreements in presidential democracies, for example. Thus, my aim with the below graphical representation from a PolSci perspective is to see to what extent coalition governments put down the terms of the multiparty deal in Western Europe. Also, while there are several beautiful visualisations in social media about research topics within PolSci, such as Andrew Heiss’ graphs on NGOs and Ruben Mathisen’s graphs on inequality, I’ve found them to have very few exemplars of graphs related to coalition politics.\nWith an eye on DataViz, I want to use the colour background that Ruben Mathisen uses in his graphs. Moreover, as I’ve seen that Outfit is the most used font by Georgios Karamanis in his submissions to TidyTuesday in the last two years, I wanted to give it a try. Given how consistently he’s been using it, it’s pretty likely that the font is pleasing to the eye.\nSo, here we go:\n\n\n\nCoalition Agreements in Western Europe\n\n\nAs it seems, written coalition agreements are common instruments for coalition governments in the region. Putting France aside, all other Western European countries witness the writing of multiparty agreements on at least a 4:1 ratio. However, these numbers are a bit misleading, as we should have to consider the number of coalition governments per country as well. To illustrate this, let’s see the percentage for the UK, which is 100%. Despite this, the number of coalition governments there equals to one (Cameron I). Hence, it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the UK is very familiar with coalition agreements since they have not even had enough multiparty governments there.\nEither way, for present purposes, I’m pretty pleased with what we’ve got. The background of the plot is pretty, the font fits well, and we’ve got a plot about coalition governments in hands. All in all, a good start to my journey of making at least one graph for month this year.\nSee you next month!"

I was basically scrolling down my feed on Bluesky when I stumbled across a post from Ting announcing a new version of the dataset. Shortly afterward, I thought that the data could provide a couple of interesting visualisations. After all, what else could be as interesting as getting to know which countries have a strong history of parliamentarians fighting one another or how common the physical violence has been in some places?\n\n\nAnnual Incidence of Fistfighting\nThe first thing I want to have a look at is which countries have most often registered at least one incident of fighting among lawmakers per year. To do so, I basically checked the variable countb.\nI didn’t want to make anything fancy, and it’s been a while since I last made a table with gt. All of this led me to make a simple table. From it, we can see that Taiwan and Ukraine had a lot of years with at least one instance of fighting in parliament. As the dataset covers a period from 1980 to 2020, it is pretty remarkable to see that Taiwan had more years with at least one recorded instance of parliamentary violence than otherwise.\n\n\n\nAt least one incident of parliamentary violence per year\n\n\n\n\nThe Temporal Aspect of Parliamentary Fistfighting\nHaving done that, my second interest is to examine the distribution of parliamentary brawls over time. Looking purely at the cumulative sum of physical fights, an additional aspect has caught my attention. Despite being positioned at the bottom of the Table above, Türkiye registered as many fighting instances as South Korea, which is some positions above in the Table. Therefore, let’s see the temporal distribution of legislative violence for the top three countries in the table, along with Türkiye.\nInspired by a DataViz from Steven Ponce, I use ggbeeswarm to represent the year points with recorded instances of parliamentary violence. Typically, ggbeeswarm is employed to prevent overlapping of categorical points. Here, however, I use only for graphical purposes.\n\n\n\nTemporal Distribution of Parliamentary Brawl\n\n\nAs can be seen, over the analysed timeframe, Taiwan has a fairly scattered record of violence in parliament. Ukraine, for its part, started to have more fighting from the late 1990s onwards. Interestingly, South Korea and Türkiye present contrasting patterns. While incidents of fistfighting decreased in South Korea from the late 2010s, they increased in Türkiye roughly around the same time. The upshot is that South Korea has more years with at least one reported case of parliamentary violence, whilst Türkiye has more concentrated instances of fighting per year. If you want to know better why this has happened in both countries, I strongly recommend reading Schmoll and Ting’s work on legislative violence, referenced previously. In it, they discuss some cases, such as those from South Korea and Türkiye, among others. In a brief summary, the South Korean case has to do with specific legislation aimed at producing more consensus building, while Türkiye’s is related to democratic backsliding.\nWell, this is what I’ve got for this month.

    "text": "Ideology\nThis month’s visualisation is slightly different from what we’ve done so far. Unlike previous months, I did not seek inspiration from submissions to Tidy Tuesday. Specifically, I want to try to do something I miserably failed in recent years. Thus far, I’ve never got to make an animated graph =(. However, this is the month when I’ll actually manage to do it!\nTo this end, I’ll rely on The Global Leader Ideology dataset from Bastian Herre. From a worldwide perspective, the data identify the ideological position of heads of government and leaders on an economic scale. More specifically, these political actors are classified as “leftist”, “centrist”, or “rightist”. A thorough explanation behind this classification can be further accessed on the dataset’s page. Importantly, a discussion about the coding of each head of government is also available.\nAs Latin America has been the focus of research, I chose it as the region for which we’ll see the ideological preferences of heads of government. Without further ado, let’s get into the plot.\n\n\nAnimated Map\nA few comments are noteworthy:\n\nI changed the colour scheme for the ideological classification when compared to the original graphs, mainly to show rightist leaders in darker blue and leftist leaders in darker red.\nSome small Caribbean states are not legible, but this is due to the adopted scale. This can be changed with the parameter alpha within geom_sf.\nTo make the animated map, I gladly followed many steps from Rodrigo Zamith and Mel Moreno and Mathieu Basille. There are other great guides on the internet, a quick search will make you find a plethora of them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Trends\n\n\n\nSome periods are marked by governments throughout the region leaning towards either the left (the Pink Tide in the early 2000s) or the right, as had been the case lately. A book examining the emergence of the new right in the region is scheduled to be released later this year. If you are interested, save the name:\nBorges, André; Lloyd, Ryan; Vommaro, Gabriel, (eds.)
