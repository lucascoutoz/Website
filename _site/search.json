    "text": "Well, I created this site at the beginning of the last year. Since then, I’ve been mostly concerned with adjusting minor details, such as setting up my research page. As a result, I have not paid enough attention to my Blog section… until now! Bluntly speaking, my main reason for finally getting my hands dirty with it is because of my resolutions for this year. Honestly, I probably would not do it otherwise.\nEven though I have pretty difficult resolutions for this year, such as dramatically reducing the amount of Coca-Cola I drink daily, I still have others which are way more realistic. One of them is making at least one DataViz per month this year, so why not make the best of it and get started with my Blog?\n\n\nIf this is the first time you hear about me, I think some introduction is in order. Well, I do not have much to say, but I’m a Brazilian Political Scientist who holds an MSc degree (in pol sci) from the University of Brasília. As for my hobbies, I would list mainly watching sports, especially football and tennis, and watching something on TV. For whatever reason, maybe because I was part of the Observatório do Congresso, an extension activity of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Brasília, I’ve developed a deep interest in Data Visualisation, which could be roughly translated to ‘yeah, I think it would be cool to make some pretty graphs’.\nOver the years, my interest in DataViz has led me to get better and better with R, albeit with the caveat that we never actually stop learning and that there’s so much I still do not know. In my opinion, the most amusing aspect of this process is how much I’ve learnt from the community itself. This site, for example, is a direct consequence of mixing lessons from Andrew Heiss, Bea Milz, and Albert Rapp. Even if I have never exchanged a single word with them, they have helped me tremendously in a variety of ways.\nThe same rings true when it comes to DataViz! Actually, most of what I know comes from accompanying the beautiful graphs made for Tidy Tuesday, a project in which the community makes a graphical representation of something based on a public dataset for each week. Even if it is impossible to namely cite all those from whom I’ve learnt something, I’d like to compliment especially Moriah Taylor’s work. Once again, she probably doesn’t even know who I am. Even still, 85% of everything I know about DataViz comes from her.\nMy only problem with TidyTuesday is that I’d rather dedicate my time to something I really love, namely politics, sports, or some random nerdy stuff. For this reason, I have my own Series. Its aim is to make me learn something new in the realm of data visualisation while I use a dataset on something related to Political Science. Sometimes, I also make visualisations about sports or some geek stuff. However, I reserve those for my social media, as I do not think someone interested in my work would search for those things on my site. In any case, for this series, I usually proceed as follows: I see a visualisation I like (most of the time from someone participating in TidyTuesday), and I try to replicate it with minor modifications to my liking. Now that I’m done talking, let’s get to today’s graph.\n\n\n\nRecently, I’ve been reading about coalition agreements. If you live in any Western European country, it’s pretty likely, as we’ll see below, that you know what I’m talking about. To those who don’t know what they are, they are basically public documents onto which governing parties put down the policies that they wish to implement/pursue while they are in office. If you want to get to know more about them, I strongly suggest you read Eichorst (2014), Moury (2011), Moury (2013), and Timmermans (2006). As this literature suggests, coalition agreements do matter for what happens in the period of coalition governance. To exemplify this, Bergman et al. (2024) find that coalition agreements are tied to heightened policy-making productivity.\nIn any case, the central point to me is that not all democracies have coalition governments with the habit of disclosing written coalition agreements. To the best of my knowledge, there are only a few instances of written coalition agreements in presidential democracies, for example. Thus, my aim with the below graphical representation from a PolSci perspective is to see to what extent coalition governments put down the terms of the multiparty deal in Western Europe. I also bear in mind that, while there are several beautiful visualisations about research topics within PolSci, such as Andrew Heiss’ graphs on NGOs and Ruben Mathisen’s graphs on inequality, there are very few exemplars of graphs related to coalition politics in social media.\nWith an eye on DataViz, I want to use the colour background that Ruben Mathisen uses in his graphs. Moreover, as I’ve seen that Outfit is the most used font by Georgios Karamanis in his submissions to TidyTuesday in the last two years, I wanted to give it a try. Given how consistently he’s been using it, it’s pretty likely that the font is pleasing to the eye.\nSo, here we go:\n\n\n\nCoalition Agreements in Western Europe\n\n\nAs it seems, written coalition agreements are common instruments for coalition governments in the region. Putting France aside, all other Western European countries witness the writing of multiparty agreements on at least a 4:1 ratio. However, these numbers are a bit misleading, as we should have to consider the number of coalition governments per country as well. To illustrate this, let’s consider the percentage for the UK. Despite boasting a percentage of 100%, the number of coalition governments there equals to one (Cameron I). Hence, it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the UK is very familiar with coalition agreements since they have not even had enough multiparty governments in the first place.\nEither way, for present purposes, I’m pretty pleased with what we’ve got. The background of the plot is pretty, the font fits well, and we’ve got a plot about coalition governments in hands. All in all, a good start to my journey of making at least one graph a month this year.\nSee you next month!\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#before you proceed, you should download the data from:

    "text": "If this is the first time you hear about me, I think some introduction is in order. Well, I do not have much to say, but I’m a Brazilian Political Scientist who holds an MSc degree (in pol sci) from the University of Brasília. As for my hobbies, I would list mainly watching sports, especially football and tennis, and watching something on TV. For whatever reason, maybe because I was part of the Observatório do Congresso, an extension activity of the Institute of Political Science at the University of Brasília, I’ve developed a deep interest in Data Visualisation, which could be roughly translated to ‘yeah, I think it would be cool to make some pretty graphs’.\nOver the years, my interest in DataViz has led me to get better and better with R, albeit with the caveat that we never actually stop learning and that there’s so much I still do not know. In my opinion, the most amusing aspect of this process is how much I’ve learnt from the community itself. This site, for example, is a direct consequence of mixing lessons from Andrew Heiss, Bea Milz, and Albert Rapp. Even if I have never exchanged a single word with them, they have helped me tremendously in a variety of ways.\nThe same rings true when it comes to DataViz! Actually, most of what I know comes from accompanying the beautiful graphs made for Tidy Tuesday, a project in which the community makes a graphical representation of something based on a public dataset for each week. Even if it is impossible to namely cite all those from whom I’ve learnt something, I’d like to compliment especially Moriah Taylor’s work. Once again, she probably doesn’t even know who I am. Even still, 85% of everything I know about DataViz comes from her.\nMy only problem with TidyTuesday is that I’d rather dedicate my time to something I really love, namely politics, sports, or some random nerdy stuff. For this reason, I have my own Series. Its aim is to make me learn something new in the realm of data visualisation while I use a dataset on something related to Political Science. Sometimes, I also make visualisations about sports or some geek stuff. However, I reserve those for my social media, as I do not think someone interested in my work would search for those things on my site. In any case, for this series, I usually proceed as follows: I see a visualisation I like (most of the time from someone participating in TidyTuesday), and I try to replicate it with minor modifications to my liking. Now that I’m done talking, let’s get to today’s graph."

    "text": "Recently, I’ve been reading about coalition agreements. If you live in any Western European country, it’s pretty likely, as we’ll see below, that you know what I’m talking about. To those who don’t know what they are, they are basically public documents onto which governing parties put down the policies that they wish to implement/pursue while they are in office. If you want to get to know more about them, I strongly suggest you read Eichorst (2014), Moury (2011), Moury (2013), and Timmermans (2006). As this literature suggests, coalition agreements do matter for what happens in the period of coalition governance. For example, Bergman et al. (2024) find that coalition agreements are tied to heightened policy-making productivity.\nIn any case, the central point to me is that not all democracies have coalition governments with the habit of disclosing written coalition agreements. To the best of my knowledge, there are only a few instances of written coalition agreements in presidential democracies, for example. Thus, my aim with the below graphical representation from a PolSci perspective is to see to what extent coalition governments put down the terms of the multiparty deal in Western Europe. Also, while there are several beautiful visualisations in social media about research topics within PolSci, such as Andrew Heiss’ graphs on NGOs and Ruben Mathisen’s graphs on inequality, I’ve found them to have very few exemplars of graphs related to coalition politics.\nWith an eye on DataViz, I want to use the colour background that Ruben Mathisen uses in his graphs. Moreover, as I’ve seen that Outfit is the most used font by Georgios Karamanis in his submissions to TidyTuesday in the last two years, I wanted to give it a try. Given how consistently he’s been using it, it’s pretty likely that the font is pleasing to the eye.\nSo, here we go:\n\n\n\nCoalition Agreements in Western Europe\n\n\nAs it seems, written coalition agreements are common instruments for coalition governments in the region. Putting France aside, all other Western European countries witness the writing of multiparty agreements on at least a 4:1 ratio. However, these numbers are a bit misleading, as we should have to consider the number of coalition governments per country as well. To illustrate this, let’s see the percentage for the UK, which is 100%. Despite this, the number of coalition governments there equals to one (Cameron I). Hence, it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the UK is very familiar with coalition agreements since they have not even had enough multiparty governments there.\nEither way, for present purposes, I’m pretty pleased with what we’ve got. The background of the plot is pretty, the font fits well, and we’ve got a plot about coalition governments in hands. All in all, a good start to my journey of making at least one graph for month this year.\nSee you next month!"

After all, what else could be as interesting as getting to know which countries have a strong history of parliamentarians fighting one another or how common the physical violence has been in some places?\n\n\nAnnual Incidence of Fistfighting\nThe first thing I want to have a look at is which countries have most often registered at least one incident of fighting among lawmakers per year. To do so, I basically checked the variable countb.\nI didn’t want to make anything fancy, and it’s been a while since I last made a table with gt. All of this led me to make a simple table. From it, we can see that Taiwan and Ukraine had a lot of years with at least one instance of fighting in parliament. As the dataset covers a period from 1980 to 2020, it is pretty remarkable to see that Taiwan had more years with at least one recorded instance of parliamentary violence than otherwise.\n\n\n\nAt least one incident of parliamentary violence per year\n\n\n\n\nThe Temporal Aspect of Parliamentary Fistfighting\nHaving done that, my second interest is to examine the distribution of parliamentary brawls over time. Looking purely at the cumulative sum of physical fights, an additional aspect has caught my attention. Despite being positioned at the bottom of the Table above, Türkiye registered as many fighting instances as South Korea, which is some positions above in the Table. Therefore, let’s see the temporal distribution of legislative violence for the top three countries in the table, along with Türkiye.\nInspired by a DataViz from Steven Ponce, I use ggbeeswarm to represent the year points with recorded instances of parliamentary violence. Typically, ggbeeswarm is employed to prevent overlapping of categorical points. Here, however, I use only for graphical purposes.\n\n\n\nTemporal Distribution of Parliamentary Brawl\n\n\nAs can be seen, over the analysed timeframe, Taiwan has a fairly scattered record of violence in parliament. Ukraine, for its part, started to have more fighting from the late 1990s onwards. Interestingly, South Korea and Türkiye present contrasting patterns. While incidents of fistfighting decreased in South Korea from the late 2010s, they increased in Türkiye roughly around the same time. The upshot is that South Korea has more years with at least one reported case of parliamentary violence, whilst Türkiye has more concentrated instances of fighting per year. If you want to know better why this has happened in both countries, I strongly recommend reading Schmoll and Ting’s work on legislative violence, referenced previously. In it, they discuss some cases, such as those from South Korea and Türkiye, among others. In a brief summary, the South Korean case has to do with specific legislation aimed at producing more consensus building, while Türkiye’s is related to democratic backsliding.\nWell, this is what I’ve got for this month.

    "title": "The Ideology of the Head of Government: A Glimpse from Latin American",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Ideology\nThis month’s visualisation is slightly different from what we’ve done so far. Unlike previous months, I did not seek inspiration from submissions to Tidy Tuesday. Specifically, I want to try to do something I miserably failed in recent years. Thus far, I’ve never got to make an animated graph =(. However, this is the month when I’ll actually manage to do it!\nTo this end, I’ll rely on The Global Leader Ideology dataset from Bastian Herre. From a worldwide perspective, the data identify the ideological position of heads of government and leaders on an economic scale. More specifically, these political actors are classified as “leftist”, “centrist”, or “rightist”. A thorough explanation behind this classification can be further accessed on the dataset’s page. Importantly, a discussion about the coding of each head of government is also available.\nAs Latin America has been the focus of research, I chose it as the region for which we’ll see the ideological preferences of heads of government. Without further ado, let’s get into the plot.\n\n\nAnimated Map\nA few comments are noteworthy:\n\nI changed the colour scheme for the ideological classification when compared to the original graphs, mainly to show rightist leaders in darker blue and leftist leaders in darker red.\nSome small Caribbean states are not legible, but this is due to the adopted scale. This can be changed with the parameter alpha within geom_sf.\nTo make the animated map, I gladly followed many steps from Rodrigo Zamith and Mel Moreno and Mathieu Basille. There are other great guides on the internet, a quick search will make you find a plethora of them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Trends\n\n\n\nSome periods are marked by governments throughout the region leaning towards either the left (the Pink Tide in the early 2000s) or the right, as had been the case lately. A book examining the emergence of the new right in the region is scheduled to be released later this year. If you are interested, save the name:\nBorges, André; Lloyd, Ryan; Vommaro, Gabriel, (eds.)

    "title": "New Zealand Parties Placement on a General right-left Dimension",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Interest in New Zealand\nAs the title says, this month’s visualisation is all about where New Zealand parties are located on the overarching right-left dimension. But where does my interest stem from? Well, basically, I recently read Bowler, Karp and Donovan (2010)’s work on strategic coalition voting, where they argue that voters cast a ballot in a strategic way, more specifically with a view on what the coalition bargaining process will result in terms of the partisan composition of the government.\nThat made me realise I know very little about New Zealand’s politics. As a result, I decided to graphically view where the main parties are located on the typical ideological spectrum of right-left in recent elections.\nTo do so, I rely on the ideological position offered by the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR), which consists of retrieving information from party manifestos. Most importantly, I use the rile variable to account for parties’ placement on the right-left dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarefulness when using data from MARPOR\n\n\n\nThe use of data from the MARPOR project is not without criticism. For example, Mikhaylov, Laver and Benoit (2012) warn that some individual categories derived from the process’ coding process are highly unreliable. This is most perniciously for our current purposes, as the variable we rely on consists exactly of a sum of several categories 🥶.\nTo circumvent this problem and ascertain the validity of the visualisation below, I should, in an ideal world, contrast the information I get from MARPOR’s data with the information from another source to ensure the parties’ policy positions are similar in the two measures. As my interest in this post is centred mainly on data visualisation, I focus only on the measure provided by the MARPOR. Be aware, then, that the figure below might not be the best representation of New Zealand’s political landscape.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ideological Positions of New Zealand Parties\nBelow, the right-left dimension is on the y-axis. Higher values indicate more right-wing policy positions and lower values indicate more left-wing inclination. Upon retrieving right-left placements of New Zealand parties from their manifestos, the figure tells us that the most right-wing party is the ACT Party. Of note, though, is that its policy position in the 2020 manifesto is substantially less extremist than its correspondent in 2017. Perhaps, this results from the party trying to present itself as a possible coalitional partner.\nEqually interesting is the traditional right-wing party, the National Party, moving increasingly rightward throughout the last three elections. Of course, this analysis is restricted to only one single overarching dimension, but I still wonder whether the mainstream right party and the radical right are becoming increasingly similar to each other. Crucially, moreover, how does the public perceive such differences? This becomes even more interesting when recent empirical research tells us that public perceptions about coalition parties are not oblivious to the cooperation between mainstream and radical parties.\nMy last remark is that it is interesting that the Labour Party has slowly but continuously moved its manifesto rightward.

    "text": "Historically, Chilean presidents have been considered so powerful that scholarly literature has constantly framed Chile as a ‘hyper-presidential’ system. However, this notion has recently been put into question. Some examples of this revisionist literature include Martínez and Dockendorff (2023) and Mimica and Navia (2024).\nThis blog post uses data from Mimica and Navia to display their argument graphically. More specifically, I plot whether presidential bills represent the lion’s share of the legislative output of the legislative process in Chile.1\nThe DataViz is not anything so fancy, just a line plot with a shaded area beneath it. I don’t know why, but this sort of graph seems to have become popular lately, perhaps due to the fact that it is slightly more attractive than a simple line plot."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This Month’s Visualisation\nThis month has been terribly hectic, to say the least. We’ve seen Modi lose his parliamentary majority in India, the ANC equally lose its majority in South Africa, Sheinbaum crowned as Mexico’s next president, and Morena getting close to a supermajority in both legislative chambers. As if that weren’t enough, the European Parliament elections have just taken place, and we’ve just had the kickoff to the Euro while awaiting the beginning of the Copa América. So, it’s safe to say that I had plenty of topics to choose from for my visualisation this month.\nDespite all this, I opted to make a visualisation related to the ideological positions of Brazilian left-of-centre parties. The reason for doing so is basically that a sentence in Zucco and Power (2024) caught my attention. On page 180, the authors highlight that “[l]eft-wing parties have slowed and sometimes reversed their migration toward the center [in Brazil’s tumultuous recent period of impeachment, populism, and polarization]”. So let’s plot these movements based on parties’ policy positions along a unidimensional scale of left-right provided by the legislators themselves!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\nTo do so, I will be using the Brazilian Legislative Survey (BLS). The BLS is an elite survey administered in every legislative term since the return to democracy. The data can be accessed here. Below, I actually use the data from Zucco and Power’s (2024) replication materials. But, in the end, they are essentially the same data.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ideological Positions of Brazilian Leftist Parties\nTo do so, I could have simply emulated my DataVis on New Zealand parties, but that certainty would not be as fun as making a new visualisation. Instead of a static graph, I then decided to make an animated lineplot!\nThe animation below depicts the ideological movements of Brazilian left-of-centre parties over the years since the redemocratisation.\n\n\n\nThe Ideological Motion of Brazilian Leftist Parties Across Time\n\n\nThe figure brings several interesting points to our attention. To begin with, as is well documented by the scholarly literature, the Workers’ Party (PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores) glaringly moved in the direction of the centre upon taking office. This more centrist version of the party only changed in the last two waves of the Brazilian Legislative Survey. Not coincidentally, these were times marked by Rousseff’s failed presidency in 2016 and Bolsonaro government in 2021. Thus, the question is whether the PT will continue its movement toward the left of the spectrum (or at least stabilise where it is) or return to the centre upon assuming the presidency again. My two cents are that this movement will depend on which grounds legislators will evaluate the PT’s policy positions. As Meyer and Wagner (2020) well demonstrate, the left-right dimension is actually an overarching dimension, encompassing both dimensions related to socioeconomic and cultural issues. Thus, if legislators put more emphasis on the PT’s stance on socioeconomic matters, then it is pretty plausible that the PT will have point estimates more toward the centre. Contrariwise, if the weight is on the PT’s stance on the cultural dimension, the opposite should be expected: the PT stabilising or even going down toward the left.\nAnother noteworthy aspect of the graph is the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB, Partido Socialista Brasileiro)’s uptick in 2017 in the direction to the centre of the ideological space. This most likely is due to the party’s participation in the Temer government, a right-of-centre government responsible for the downfall of former president Rousseff from the PT. Well, the PSB held the Ministry of Mines and Energy in that government. It would be quite interesting to probe whether voters’ perceptions of the PSB also shifted towards the right after the party’s involvement in the Temer government.\nLastly, it is interesting to note that the confidence intervals for the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB, Partido Comunista do Brasil) exploded in the last wave. To be honest, I don’t have any immediate explanation for this. I initially thought that it might result from the party’s small seat share in the Chamber of Deputies, but it actually managed to have a stable, though small, legislative presence from 2014 to 2018. Well, I’m not very optimistic about the normalisation of the confidence intervals for the PCdoB’s policy positions, but let’s see what happens in the next wave of the BLS!\nI’ve a few qualms about some aspects of the above visualisation, such as the hyphen superimposed over the acronym PCdoB and possibly some issues with font size, but this is what it is.

In the last months, I’ve been reading some scholarship about the countries in the region, such as a recent piece on how academic research can have a meaningful impact on the perception of election integrity, with evidence from South Korea, and experimental evidence from Japan warning how gender bias is present even in the details, manifested through the preference for lower-pitched candidates. I’ve also read a pretty interesting comparative work on coalition governments in Asian-Pacific democracies. I’m sure there’s much more I still haven’t put my hands on, but that was enough to spark my interest in the region!\nThough all of this certainly has led me to explore East Asia now, there’s also a personal reason for it. Well, the fact is that I’ve made a few visualisations about Africa before, some about Europe, a lot about the American continent,1 and recently explored Oceania through New Zealand’s partisan politics. It’s finally time to finish covering all the continents (apart from Antarctica duhh) with Asia now!"

Needless to say, I am very excited about what lies ahead!!!\nTo get off to a quick start, I’ve made two plots about immigration in Denmark.

To hit the ground running from the beginning, I’ll devote less time to writing my posts. This doesn’t mean that I’ll stop with my visualisations. To conclude my resolutions for this year, I’ll regularly post a visualisation til the end of this year. However, I don’t know if I’ll keep doing this next year."
