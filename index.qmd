Welcome!

I am Lucas, and I hold a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Political Science, which I obtained from the [University of Bras√≠lia](http://ipol.unb.br/) in July 2023. As of now, I am preparing to take the next step and be a PhD student somewhere. My research interests lie predominantly in Coalition Governments, Comparative Politics, Legislative Studies and Methodology.

Most of my work departs from a comparative perspective and has appeared in *Dados* and *The British Journal of Politics and International Relations*, among other outlets.

While my journey in Political Science is in its infancy, I have a long-term goal to develop a sound methodological basis. Today, I am comfortable with quantitative methods and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).
