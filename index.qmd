Welcome!

I am Lucas, and I am a PhD Student in Political Science at [Aarhus University](https://ps.au.dk/en). Before that, I did my BSc and MSc in Political Science at [University of Bras√≠lia](http://ipol.unb.br/). My research interest lie predominantly in Coalition Governments, Comparative Politics, Comparative Political Behaviour, and Legislative Studies.

Most of my work departs from a comparative perspective and has appeared in the *Brazilian Political Science Review*, *Dados* and *The British Journal of Politics and International Relations*, amongst other outlets.

Whilst my journey in Political Science is in its infancy, I have a long-term goal of developing a sound methodological basis. Today, I am comfortable with *standard* quantitative methods and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), and I am looking forward to dealing with experiments in the near future.
