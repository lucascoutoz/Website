Welcome!

I am currently a Master's Student in Political Science at the [University of Bras√≠lia](http://ipol.unb.br/), wherein I intend to conclude my studies by the end of June 2023. My research interests lie predominantly in Bicameralism, Coalition Governments, Legislative Studies and Methodology. 

Most of my work departs from a comparative perspective and has appeared in *Dados* and *The British Journal of Politics and International Relations*, among other outlets.
