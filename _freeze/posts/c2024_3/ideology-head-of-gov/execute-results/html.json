Unlike previous months, I did not seek inspiration from submissions to [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Specifically, I want to try to do something I miserably failed in recent years. Thus far, I've never got to make an animated graph =(. However, this is the month when I'll actually manage to do it!\n\nTo this end, I'll rely on [The Global Leader Ideology dataset](https://github.com/bastianherre/global-leader-ideologies) from [Bastian Herre](https://www.bastianherre.com/data). From a worldwide perspective, the data identify the ideological position of heads of government and leaders on an economic scale. More specifically, these political actors are classified as “leftist”, “centrist”, or “rightist”. A thorough explanation behind this classification can be further accessed on the dataset's page. Importantly, a discussion about the coding of each head of government is also [available](https://github.com/bastianherre/global-leader-ideologies/tree/main/Country%20profiles/pdf).\n\nAs Latin America has been the focus of research, I chose it as the region for which we'll see the ideological preferences of heads of government. Without further ado, let's get into the plot.\n\n# Animated Map\n\nA few comments are noteworthy:\n\n1) I changed the colour scheme for the ideological classification when compared to the [original graphs](https://github.com/bastianherre/global-leader-ideologies/blob/main/Graphs/ideology_lac.png), mainly to show rightist leaders in darker blue and leftist leaders in darker red.\n\n2) Some small Caribbean states are not legible, but this is due to the adopted scale. This can be changed with the parameter *alpha* within geom_sf.\n\n3) To make the animated map, I gladly followed many steps from [Rodrigo Zamith](https://dds.rodrigozamith.com/cartography-and-journalism/creating-animated-maps-with-r/) and [Mel Moreno and Mathieu Basille](https://r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html). There are other great guides on the internet, a quick search will make you find a plethora of them! \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Regional Trends\n\nSome periods are marked by governments throughout the region leaning towards either the left (the Pink Tide in the early 2000s) or the right, as had been the case lately. A book examining the emergence of the new right in the region is scheduled to be released later this year.
